        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country
        singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The
        singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me"
        found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She
        incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012),
        later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop
        set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued
        Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one
        singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off",
        "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".
